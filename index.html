        <h3>by Rachel Armstrong</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Returned to school</strong></p>
    
        <p>It's been fun</p>
        
        <p><strong>Can't believe the work begun</strong></p>

        <p>It's not very cool</p>
        
        <p><strong>Having to be in school</strong></p>
        
        <p>I feel like I'm tired all of the time</p>
        
        <p><strong>When the semester ends</strong></p>
        
        <p>I don't think I'll be sad</p>
        
        <p><strong>If anything, I'll definitely be glad</strong></p>
        
        <p>Can't wait till this semster ends</p>
